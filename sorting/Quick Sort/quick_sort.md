### Quick Sort â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

**Quick Sort** is another popular **divide and conquer** algorithm used to sort an array or a list. It works by selecting a "pivot" element from the array, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the subarrays.

### Quick Sort Algorithm

1. **Pivot Selection**: Choose an element from the array to act as the pivot. There are various strategies to choose the pivot:
   - First element
   - Last element
   - Random element
   - Median of three

2. **Partitioning**: Rearrange the elements of the array such that:
   - All elements less than the pivot are placed before the pivot.
   - All elements greater than the pivot are placed after it.
   
   After this, the pivot is in its correct position in the sorted array.

3. **Recursion**: Recursively apply the quicksort algorithm to the subarrays on the left and right of the pivot.

### Time Complexity

- **Best and Average Case**: \(O(n \log n)\) when the pivot splits the array into two nearly equal halves.
- **Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\) when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element (e.g., if the array is already sorted).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\) for the recursive stack in the best case.

### C++ Code for Quick Sort

Let's implement Quick Sort step-by-step in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

using namespace std;

// Function to partition the array into two halves based on the pivot
int partition(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
    // Choose the last element as pivot
    int pivot = arr[high];
    int i = low - 1; // Pointer for the smaller element

    for (int j = low; j <= high - 1; j++) {
        // If current element is smaller than or equal to pivot
        if (arr[j] <= pivot) {
            i++;
            swap(arr[i], arr[j]); // Swap arr[i] and arr[j]
        }
    }
    // Swap the pivot element with the element at i + 1 to place the pivot in the correct position
    swap(arr[i + 1], arr[high]);
    return (i + 1);
}

// Function to perform the Quick Sort
void quickSort(vector<int>& arr, int low, int high) {
    if (low < high) {
        // Find pivot element such that arr[pivot] is in the correct position
        int pi = partition(arr, low, high);

        // Recursively sort the two halves
        quickSort(arr, low, pi - 1);  // Sort elements before pivot
        quickSort(arr, pi + 1, high); // Sort elements after pivot
    }
}

// Function to print the array
void printArray(const vector<int>& arr) {
    for (int i : arr) {
        cout << i << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}

int main() {
    // Example input
    vector<int> arr = {10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70};

    cout << "Given array: ";
    printArray(arr);

    // Perform Quick Sort on the array
    quickSort(arr, 0, arr.size() - 1);

    cout << "Sorted array: ";
    printArray(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code:

1. **partition() function**:
   - The `partition()` function selects the last element as the pivot.
   - It then rearranges the array such that all elements smaller than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot and all elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right.
   - Finally, it places the pivot in its correct position in the sorted array and returns the index of the pivot.

2. **quickSort() function**:
   - This function is the main part of the Quick Sort algorithm.
   - It recursively divides the array into two subarrays: elements before the pivot and elements after the pivot.
   - Each subarray is sorted by calling the `quickSort()` function again on the subarrays.

3. **printArray() function**:
   - A simple utility function to print the elements of the array to verify the result.

4. **Main function**:
   - The array is initialized with some test data.
   - The `quickSort()` function is called to sort the array.
   - The sorted array is printed.

### Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**
```
{10, 80, 30, 90, 40, 50, 70}
```

**Step 1: First partitioning:**

- Pivot: 70 (last element)
- After partitioning, the array becomes:
  ```
  [10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 90, 80]
  ```
  Pivot (70) is now in its correct position at index 4.

**Step 2: Recursively apply Quick Sort on the two subarrays:**

1. Left subarray: `[10, 30, 40, 50]`
   - Pivot: 50 (last element)
   - After partitioning, the array becomes:
     ```
     [10, 30, 40, 50]
     ```
     Pivot (50) is in its correct position at index 3.

2. Right subarray: `[90, 80]`
   - Pivot: 80 (last element)
   - After partitioning, the array becomes:
     ```
     [10, 30, 40, 50, 70, 80, 90]
     ```
     Pivot (80) is in its correct position at index 6.

**Step 3: Recursion ends when the subarrays contain one or zero elements.**

**Output:**
```
Sorted array: 10 30 40 50 70 80 90
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Best Case**: \(O(n \log n)\), when the pivot divides the array into two roughly equal halves.
- **Average Case**: \(O(n \log n)\), which happens when the pivot does a good job of dividing the array.
- **Worst Case**: \(O(n^2)\), which happens when the pivot is always the smallest or largest element (for example, if the array is already sorted or reverse-sorted).

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(\log n)\) on average for the recursion stack, as the depth of the recursion tree is logarithmic in the best and average cases.
- In the worst case, the recursion depth can be as large as \(O(n)\), leading to \(O(n)\) space complexity.

### Conclusion:
- **Quick Sort** is an efficient sorting algorithm with a **best-case** and **average-case time complexity** of \(O(n \log n)\).
- It is typically faster than other \(O(n \log n)\) algorithms, like Merge Sort, due to smaller hidden constants and the fact that it sorts in place (does not require extra space for merging).
- However, its **worst-case** time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which can be mitigated by using better pivot selection strategies (like random pivot or median of three).
