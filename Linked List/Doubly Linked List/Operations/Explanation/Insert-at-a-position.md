### Explanation of the `insertAtPosition` Function Step by Step

The function `insertAtPosition` inserts a new node with a given value at a specified position in a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)**. Let's break it down step by step.

#### **Function Prototype:**
```cpp
void insertAtPosition(int value, int position);
```
- **`value`**: The data value that will be inserted in the new node.
- **`position`**: The 1-based index at which the new node should be inserted.

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown of the Code**

#### 1. **Check for Invalid Position:**
```cpp
if (position < 1) {
    cout << "Invalid position!" << endl;
    return;
}
```
- **Objective**: Ensure that the position is valid.
- **Explanation**: If the given `position` is less than 1, it's not a valid position in the list because linked lists are typically 1-based indexed.
- **Action**: If the position is invalid, print `"Invalid position!"` and exit the function.

---

#### 2. **Check if Position is 1 (Insert at Beginning):**
```cpp
if (position == 1) {
    insertAtBeginning(value);
    return;
}
```
- **Objective**: Handle the case where the insertion is at the beginning of the list (position 1).
- **Explanation**: If the `position` is 1, we can simply insert the new node at the beginning using the `insertAtBeginning` function. This is a shortcut that avoids unnecessary traversal.
- **Action**: Insert at the beginning and return from the function, skipping the rest of the code.

---

#### 3. **Create a New Node:**
```cpp
Node* newNode = new Node(value);
```
- **Objective**: Create a new node that will be inserted at the specified position.
- **Explanation**: A new node is created using `new` and its `data` is set to the provided `value`. The `next` and `prev` pointers are initialized to `nullptr` by default because it is a new node that hasn’t been linked yet.

---

#### 4. **Start Traversing the List to Find the Insertion Point:**
```cpp
Node* temp = head;
int count = 1;
```
- **Objective**: Traverse the list to find the node at the specified `position`.
- **Explanation**: 
  - `temp` is initialized to `head`, meaning we start from the beginning of the list.
  - `count` is initialized to 1 to keep track of the current position during traversal.

---

#### 5. **Traverse the List to Reach the Desired Position:**
```cpp
while (temp != nullptr && count < position) {
    temp = temp->next;
    count++;
}
```
- **Objective**: Traverse the list until the desired position is reached.
- **Explanation**:
  - The `while` loop continues until:
    - `temp` becomes `nullptr` (which means we’ve reached the end of the list).
    - `count` reaches the specified `position`.
  - **Note**: `temp` moves through the list using the `next` pointer, and `count` is incremented to track the position in the list.

---

#### 6. **Check if Position is Out of Range:**
```cpp
if (!temp) {
    cout << "Position out of range!" << endl;
    return;
}
```
- **Objective**: Ensure the position is within the bounds of the list.
- **Explanation**: 
  - After the loop, if `temp` is `nullptr`, it means the position is beyond the end of the list (i.e., there are fewer nodes than the specified position).
  - **Action**: If `temp` is `nullptr`, print `"Position out of range!"` and return from the function without performing any insertion.

---

#### 7. **Insert the New Node Between the Nodes:**
```cpp
newNode->next = temp;
newNode->prev = temp->prev;
```
- **Objective**: Prepare the new node for insertion between `temp` and its previous node.
- **Explanation**:
  - `newNode->next = temp`: The `next` pointer of the new node should point to the node currently at the `position` (i.e., `temp`).
  - `newNode->prev = temp->prev`: The `prev` pointer of the new node should point to the node before `temp` (i.e., `temp->prev`).

---

#### 8. **Link the Previous Node to the New Node:**
```cpp
if (temp->prev) {
    temp->prev->next = newNode;
}
```
- **Objective**: Update the previous node’s `next` pointer to point to the new node.
- **Explanation**: 
  - If `temp->prev` is not `nullptr` (i.e., `temp` is not the head node), then:
    - Set the `next` pointer of the node before `temp` (`temp->prev`) to point to the new node.
- **Action**: This connects the new node to the list, linking it in the correct position.

---

#### 9. **Link the `temp` Node to the New Node:**
```cpp
temp->prev = newNode;
```
- **Objective**: Update the `prev` pointer of the current node (`temp`) to point to the new node.
- **Explanation**: This step ensures that `temp`'s `prev` pointer is correctly updated to link it to the new node.
- **Action**: The new node is now properly inserted between its two neighbors (the node before it and the node after it).

---

### **Summary:**

1. **Invalid Position**: If the position is less than 1, the function returns an error.
2. **Position 1**: If the position is 1, it directly calls the `insertAtBeginning` function to handle the insertion.
3. **Create New Node**: A new node is created with the given value.
4. **Traverse the List**: The function traverses the list to reach the node at the desired position.
5. **Out of Range Check**: If the position is out of bounds, the function exits.
6. **Insert Node**: The new node is inserted by adjusting the `next` and `prev` pointers of the surrounding nodes.
7. **Linking**: The new node is linked correctly to its neighbors.

This process ensures that the node is inserted at the correct position in the doubly linked list while maintaining all the necessary pointers for bidirectional traversal.
