Let’s go through the `reverseList` function step by step with an example linked list. We'll use the list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL`.

### Initial Setup:
- `prev = nullptr`: This pointer will eventually become the new head of the reversed list.
- `curr = head`: This pointer initially points to the first node of the list.
- `next = nullptr`: This will be used to temporarily store the next node while we reverse the pointers.

### Linked List (Initial):
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
```
Where `head` points to the node with value `1`.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **First Iteration:**
   - `curr = 1` (the first node of the list)
   - `next = curr->next = 2` (store the next node, which is `2`)
   - `curr->next = prev = nullptr` (reverse the `next` pointer of node `1`, so it now points to `nullptr`)
   - `prev = curr = 1` (move `prev` to the current node)
   - `curr = next = 2` (move `curr` to the next node)
   
   **Linked List (After 1st Iteration):**
   ```
   1 -> NULL   (prev points to 1)
   2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL   (curr points to 2)
   ```

2. **Second Iteration:**
   - `curr = 2`
   - `next = curr->next = 3` (store the next node, which is `3`)
   - `curr->next = prev = 1` (reverse the `next` pointer of node `2`, so it now points to `1`)
   - `prev = curr = 2` (move `prev` to the current node)
   - `curr = next = 3` (move `curr` to the next node)

   **Linked List (After 2nd Iteration):**
   ```
   2 -> 1 -> NULL   (prev points to 2)
   3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL   (curr points to 3)
   ```

3. **Third Iteration:**
   - `curr = 3`
   - `next = curr->next = 4` (store the next node, which is `4`)
   - `curr->next = prev = 2` (reverse the `next` pointer of node `3`, so it now points to `2`)
   - `prev = curr = 3` (move `prev` to the current node)
   - `curr = next = 4` (move `curr` to the next node)

   **Linked List (After 3rd Iteration):**
   ```
   3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL   (prev points to 3)
   4 -> 5 -> NULL   (curr points to 4)
   ```

4. **Fourth Iteration:**
   - `curr = 4`
   - `next = curr->next = 5` (store the next node, which is `5`)
   - `curr->next = prev = 3` (reverse the `next` pointer of node `4`, so it now points to `3`)
   - `prev = curr = 4` (move `prev` to the current node)
   - `curr = next = 5` (move `curr` to the next node)

   **Linked List (After 4th Iteration):**
   ```
   4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL   (prev points to 4)
   5 -> NULL   (curr points to 5)
   ```

5. **Fifth Iteration:**
   - `curr = 5`
   - `next = curr->next = nullptr` (store the next node, which is `nullptr` as it's the last node)
   - `curr->next = prev = 4` (reverse the `next` pointer of node `5`, so it now points to `4`)
   - `prev = curr = 5` (move `prev` to the current node)
   - `curr = next = nullptr` (move `curr` to `nullptr`, which indicates the end of the list)

   **Linked List (After 5th Iteration):**
   ```
   5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL   (prev points to 5)
   ```

### Final Result:
Now that `curr` is `nullptr`, the loop exits, and we return `prev`, which points to the new head of the reversed list (node with value `5`).

### Reversed Linked List:
```
5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
```

### Summary of Key Operations:
- We traverse the list once (O(n) time complexity).
- At each step, we reverse the direction of the current node's pointer by changing `curr->next` to `prev`.
- We use three pointers (`prev`, `curr`, `next`) to ensure that we don't lose track of the remaining nodes while reversing the pointers.

This approach successfully reverses the singly linked list in-place without needing additional memory for a new list.

Cycle detection in a linked list is an important problem where you need to determine if the list contains a cycle (i.e., a node's `next` pointer eventually points back to a previous node, creating a loop). There are several ways to detect cycles in a linked list, but the most efficient approach is **Floyd’s Cycle-Finding Algorithm**, also known as the **Tortoise and Hare** algorithm. 

### Key Idea:
The idea is to use two pointers:
1. **Slow pointer (tortoise)** moves one step at a time.
2. **Fast pointer (hare)** moves two steps at a time.

If the list contains a cycle, at some point, the fast pointer will catch up with the slow pointer. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (`nullptr`), then the list doesn't contain a cycle.

### Steps of Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm:
1. Initialize two pointers: `slow` and `fast`. Both start at the head of the linked list.
2. Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps at each iteration.
3. If the list has a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet at the same node. If `fast` reaches `nullptr`, then there is no cycle.
4. The time complexity of this approach is O(n), and the space complexity is O(1) since only two pointers are used.

### C++ Code for Cycle Detection:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Definition of the Node structure
struct Node {
    int data;
    Node* next;
    
    // Constructor to create a new node
    Node(int val) {
        data = val;
        next = nullptr;
    }
};

// Function to detect a cycle in the linked list
bool detectCycle(Node* head) {
    if (head == nullptr || head->next == nullptr) {
        return false;  // If the list is empty or contains just one node, no cycle.
    }
    
    Node* slow = head;  // Slow pointer (tortoise)
    Node* fast = head;  // Fast pointer (hare)
    
    while (fast != nullptr && fast->next != nullptr) {
        slow = slow->next;           // Move slow by one step
        fast = fast->next->next;     // Move fast by two steps
        
        if (slow == fast) {
            return true;  // Cycle detected when both pointers meet
        }
    }
    
    return false;  // No cycle detected
}

// Function to append a new node to the list
void append(Node*& head, int data) {
    Node* newNode = new Node(data);
    if (head == nullptr) {
        head = newNode;
        return;
    }
    Node* temp = head;
    while (temp->next != nullptr) {
        temp = temp->next;
    }
    temp->next = newNode;
}

// Function to create a cycle in the linked list (for testing)
void createCycle(Node* head, int pos) {
    Node* temp = head;
    Node* cycleNode = nullptr;
    int counter = 1;
    
    // Traverse to the position where we want to create a cycle
    while (temp->next != nullptr) {
        if (counter == pos) {
            cycleNode = temp;  // Save the node to create a cycle
        }
        temp = temp->next;
        counter++;
    }
    
    // If cycleNode is found, create a cycle by linking the last node to it
    if (cycleNode != nullptr) {
        temp->next = cycleNode;
    }
}

int main() {
    Node* head = nullptr;
    
    // Creating a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
    append(head, 1);
    append(head, 2);
    append(head, 3);
    append(head, 4);
    append(head, 5);
    
    // Uncomment the following line to create a cycle (e.g., a cycle at position 3)
    // createCycle(head, 3);
    
    if (detectCycle(head)) {
        cout << "Cycle detected!" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No cycle detected." << endl;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Node Structure**: 
   - A `Node` is defined with an integer `data` and a pointer `next` pointing to the next node in the list.

2. **`detectCycle` Function**:
   - It initializes two pointers: `slow` (tortoise) and `fast` (hare), both starting from the `head`.
   - The `slow` pointer moves one step at a time, while the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time.
   - If `slow` and `fast` meet at any point, a cycle is detected.
   - If `fast` reaches `nullptr` (end of the list), there is no cycle.

3. **`createCycle` Function** (for testing):
   - This function helps to manually create a cycle in the linked list by linking the last node back to a node at a given position (index).
   - For example, if `pos = 3`, the last node will point to the node at position 3, creating a cycle.

4. **`main` Function**:
   - First, a linked list is created with nodes containing the values `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`.
   - Then, the cycle detection function `detectCycle` is called to check if there is a cycle in the linked list.
   - If there is a cycle, it prints "Cycle detected!". Otherwise, it prints "No cycle detected.".

### Example 1: No Cycle
For a regular list without any cycle:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
```

The output will be:

```
No cycle detected.
```

### Example 2: With Cycle
If you uncomment the `createCycle(head, 3)` line, you create a cycle at position `3`, so the list becomes:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ^           |
          |-----------|
```

In this case, the output will be:

```
Cycle detected!
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The algorithm traverses the list only once, making it linear in time complexity.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The space complexity is constant because only two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) are used for cycle detection.

### Summary:
- Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare) is an efficient way to detect cycles in a linked list.
- By using two pointers that move at different speeds, the algorithm can detect cycles in O(n) time and O(1) space.

The sliding window technique is a popular algorithmic approach used to solve problems that involve sequences or arrays, such as finding subarrays, substrings, or sublists with certain properties (e.g., maximum, minimum, sum, etc.). The idea is to maintain a window (a subarray or substring) that moves or slides through the input, adjusting its boundaries as needed to solve the problem efficiently.

### Sliding Window Concept:

A sliding window allows us to process a subarray (or substring) of a given size and move the window over the input sequence to perform computations more efficiently. Instead of recalculating the result from scratch as the window slides, we adjust the result incrementally using the new elements and removing the old ones.

### Types of Sliding Window:
1. **Fixed-size Sliding Window**: The size of the window remains constant, and you move the window across the array.
2. **Dynamic-size Sliding Window**: The size of the window can change based on certain conditions (e.g., subarrays with a sum less than a target value).

### Common Use Cases:
1. Finding the maximum or minimum sum of a subarray of size `k`.
2. Finding the longest substring with at most `k` distinct characters.
3. Finding a subarray with a sum equal to a given value.

---

### Steps to Solve Using the Sliding Window Technique:

### 1. **Fixed-size Sliding Window**
In this case, the window has a constant size, and the task is usually to compute something (e.g., sum, maximum, etc.) for each subarray of that size.

#### Example: Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

#### Example Problem:
Given an array of integers, find the maximum sum of any subarray of size `k`.

**Example Input:**
```cpp
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
k = 3
```

**Example Output:**
The maximum sum of a subarray of size 3 is `15` (which is `4 + 5 + 6`).

#### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initial Setup**: Initialize the sum of the first `k` elements.
2. **Sliding the Window**: Move the window one step at a time. Subtract the element that is left behind and add the next element to the window.
3. **Track Maximum Sum**: Keep track of the maximum sum encountered as the window slides.

#### C++ Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxSumSubarray(const vector<int>& arr, int k) {
    int n = arr.size();
    
    if (n < k) {
        return -1; // Not enough elements for a subarray of size k
    }
    
    // Step 1: Calculate the sum of the first window
    int windowSum = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        windowSum += arr[i];
    }

    // Step 2: Slide the window and calculate the sum for each window
    int maxSum = windowSum;
    for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
        // Slide the window right: subtract the element that goes out and add the element that comes in
        windowSum += arr[i] - arr[i - k];
        maxSum = max(maxSum, windowSum);
    }

    return maxSum;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int k = 3;

    int result = maxSumSubarray(arr, k);
    cout << "Maximum sum of subarray of size " << k << " is: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Window**: We first calculate the sum of the first `k` elements (`1 + 2 + 3 = 6`).
2. **Sliding the Window**:
   - In the next step, we slide the window by one element. We remove the first element (1) and add the next element (4) to get the new sum (`6 - 1 + 4 = 9`).
   - We repeat this process for the rest of the elements. Each time, we adjust the window sum by subtracting the element that leaves the window and adding the new element that enters.
3. **Track Maximum Sum**: During each step, we track the maximum sum.

The result is `15`, which is the maximum sum of any subarray of size `3`.

---

### 2. **Dynamic-size Sliding Window**
In this case, the size of the window is not fixed, and it expands or contracts based on a condition.

#### Example Problem: Longest Substring with At Most `k` Distinct Characters
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `k` distinct characters.

**Example Input:**
```cpp
s = "eceba"
k = 2
```

**Example Output:**
The longest substring with at most 2 distinct characters is `"ece"`, which has a length of `3`.

#### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initial Setup**: Use a sliding window with two pointers (left and right) and a hash map to store the frequency of characters in the window.
2. **Expand the Window**: Move the right pointer to expand the window and include new characters.
3. **Shrink the Window**: If the window contains more than `k` distinct characters, move the left pointer to shrink the window until there are at most `k` distinct characters.
4. **Track Maximum Length**: Keep track of the maximum window length.

#### C++ Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int longestSubstringKDistinct(const string& s, int k) {
    int n = s.length();
    if (n == 0 || k == 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    unordered_map<char, int> charCount;
    int left = 0, maxLength = 0;

    for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        // Expand the window by including the current character
        charCount[s[right]]++;

        // If the window contains more than 'k' distinct characters, shrink it from the left
        while (charCount.size() > k) {
            charCount[s[left]]--;
            if (charCount[s[left]] == 0) {
                charCount.erase(s[left]);
            }
            left++;
        }

        // Calculate the maximum length of the substring
        maxLength = max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
}

int main() {
    string s = "eceba";
    int k = 2;

    int result = longestSubstringKDistinct(s, k);
    cout << "Longest substring with at most " << k << " distinct characters is: " << result << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: The `left` pointer represents the start of the window, and the `right` pointer expands the window.
2. **Expand the Window**: The right pointer moves to the right, adding characters to the window. We also update the frequency of characters using a hash map (`unordered_map`).
3. **Shrink the Window**: If the window contains more than `k` distinct characters, the `left` pointer is moved to shrink the window until there are `k` or fewer distinct characters.
4. **Track Maximum Length**: The maximum window length is updated as we slide the window across the string.

The output is `3`, which is the length of the longest substring with at most `2` distinct characters.

---

### Summary:
- **Fixed-size Sliding Window**: This approach involves maintaining a window of a fixed size and sliding it across the array while updating the result incrementally.
- **Dynamic-size Sliding Window**: The window size can vary based on certain conditions (e.g., a target sum or a condition on the number of distinct characters).
- The sliding window technique is efficient, often reducing time complexity to **O(n)**, which is much better than recalculating from scratch in each step.
