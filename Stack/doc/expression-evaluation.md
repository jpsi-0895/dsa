Expression evaluation is a common use case for stacks, especially when dealing with **infix**, **prefix**, and **postfix** expressions. Here, we'll focus on **postfix notation** (also known as Reverse Polish Notation or RPN), where operators follow their operands.

In postfix expressions, you evaluate the expression from left to right using a stack to store operands. When an operator is encountered, the required number of operands is popped from the stack, the operator is applied, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

### Steps for Evaluating Postfix Expression:
1. **Initialize an empty stack.**
2. **Iterate through the expression:**
   - If the character is a number (operand), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is an operator, pop the operands from the stack, apply the operator, and push the result back onto the stack.
3. **At the end of the iteration, the stack will contain one element, which is the result of the expression.**

### Example: Evaluating Postfix Expression in C++

Let's evaluate the postfix expression: `3 4 + 2 * 7 /`

#### Steps:
- `3` and `4` are operands, so push them onto the stack.
- `+` is an operator, pop `3` and `4`, compute `3 + 4 = 7`, and push the result (`7`) back onto the stack.
- `2` is an operand, so push it onto the stack.
- `*` is an operator, pop `7` and `2`, compute `7 * 2 = 14`, and push the result (`14`) back onto the stack.
- `7` is an operand, so push it onto the stack.
- `/` is an operator, pop `14` and `7`, compute `14 / 7 = 2`, and push the result (`2`) back onto the stack.
- At the end, the stack contains one value: `2`, which is the final result.

#### C++ Code Implementation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stack>
#include <sstream>
#include <cctype>  // For isdigit()

// Function to evaluate a postfix expression
int evaluatePostfix(const std::string& expr) {
    std::stack<int> stack;
    std::istringstream iss(expr);
    std::string token;

    while (iss >> token) {
        if (isdigit(token[0])) {
            // If the token is a number, push it onto the stack
            stack.push(std::stoi(token));
        } else {
            // If the token is an operator, pop operands and apply the operator
            int b = stack.top(); stack.pop();
            int a = stack.top(); stack.pop();
            
            switch (token[0]) {
                case '+': stack.push(a + b); break;
                case '-': stack.push(a - b); break;
                case '*': stack.push(a * b); break;
                case '/': stack.push(a / b); break;
                default:
                    std::cerr << "Unsupported operator: " << token << std::endl;
                    return -1;
            }
        }
    }

    // The result is the only element left in the stack
    return stack.top();
}

int main() {
    std::string expr = "3 4 + 2 * 7 /";  // Example postfix expression

    int result = evaluatePostfix(expr);
    std::cout << "Result: " << result << std::endl;  // Output should be 2

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input**: The input is a string containing a postfix expression, with tokens (operands and operators) separated by spaces.
   
2. **Stack**: A stack is used to hold operands (numbers) as we process the postfix expression.

3. **Iteration**:
   - We use a `std::istringstream` to split the input string into individual tokens.
   - Each token is processed:
     - If the token is a number (`isdigit(token[0])`), it is pushed onto the stack.
     - If the token is an operator, the two operands are popped from the stack, the operation is applied, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

4. **Final Result**: At the end of the iteration, the stack will have one element left, which is the result of the postfix expression.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the input expression `3 4 + 2 * 7 /`:

1. **Push operands**:
   - `3` → stack: `[3]`
   - `4` → stack: `[3, 4]`
   
2. **Apply operator `+`**:
   - Pop `4` and `3`, compute `3 + 4 = 7`, push result `7` → stack: `[7]`
   
3. **Push operand**:
   - `2` → stack: `[7, 2]`
   
4. **Apply operator `*`**:
   - Pop `2` and `7`, compute `7 * 2 = 14`, push result `14` → stack: `[14]`
   
5. **Push operand**:
   - `7` → stack: `[14, 7]`
   
6. **Apply operator `/`**:
   - Pop `7` and `14`, compute `14 / 7 = 2`, push result `2` → stack: `[2]`
   
7. **Final result**: The stack contains the result `2`.

### Handling Errors:
- This implementation assumes that the expression is valid and that there are no division by zero errors.
- You can add more error checks such as verifying if the stack has enough operands before applying an operator, or checking for invalid characters in the expression.

### Conclusion:
Postfix expression evaluation using a stack is an efficient way to compute the result of expressions without worrying about parentheses or operator precedence. This approach is commonly used in calculators, compilers, and interpreters to evaluate mathematical expressions.
