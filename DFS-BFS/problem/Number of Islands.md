Given a binary 2D matrix, find the number of islands. A group of connected 1s forms an island. For example, the below matrix contains 4 islands.

Examples:

Input: M[][] = {{‘1’, ‘1’, ‘0’, ‘0’, ‘0’},
                         {‘0’, ‘1’, ‘0’, ‘0’, ‘1’},
                         {‘1’, ‘0’, ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘1’},
                        {‘0’, ‘0’, ‘0’, ‘0’, ‘0’},
                       {‘1’, ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘1’, ‘0’}}
Output: 4
Explanation: The image below shows all the 4 islands in the graph
